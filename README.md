### Project Description

This is a program which will produce an image in which each colour occurs exactly once -- with no repetition and no used colours. Colours are formed by combining a red, green, and blue component in the range 0..256; your program will need to break each component into 32 steps -- 8, 16,24, .. 256 -- which means you will have 32,768 discrete colours. Your image will therefore need to be sized to accommodate exactly this number of unique colours -- for example, 256x128px (although other dimensions are possible).


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
